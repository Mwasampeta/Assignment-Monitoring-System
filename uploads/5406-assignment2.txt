Definition:
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are non-subsidiary, independent firms which employ fewer than a given number of employees. This number varies across countries. The most frequent upper limit designating an SME is 250 employees, as in the European Union. However, some countries set the limit at 200 employees, while the United States considers SMEs to include firms with fewer than 500 employees.

Small firms are generally those with fewer than 50 employees, while micro-enterprises have at most 10, or in some cases 5, workers.

Financial assets are also used to define SMEs. In the European Union, a new definition came into force on 1 January 2005 applying to all Community acts and funding programmes as well as in the field of State aid where SMEs can be granted higher intensity of national and regional aid than large companies. The new definition provides for an increase in the financial ceilings: the turnover of medium-sized enterprises (50-249 employees) should not exceed EUR 50 million; that of small enterprises (10-49 employees) should not exceed EUR 10 million while that of micro firms (less than 10 employees) should not exceed EUR 2 million. Alternatively, balance sheets for medium, small and micro enterprises should not exceed EUR 43 million, EUR 10 million and EUR 2 million, respectively.


What is a Small and Mid-size Enterprise (SME)?
Small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) are businesses that maintain revenues, assets or a number of employees below a certain threshold. Each country has its own definition of what constitutes a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME). Certain size criteria must be met and occasionally the industry in which the company operates in is taken into account as well.
Though small in size, small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in the economy. They outnumber large firms considerably, employ vast numbers of people and are generally entrepreneurial in nature, helping to shape innovatio
Understanding Microenterprises
Microenterprises are small businesses that are financed by microcredit, a type of credit facility given to people who have no collateral credit history, or employment. These businesses serve a vital purpose in improving the quality of life for people in developing countries, and generally provide a good or service in their communities such as clothing and footwear production or agriculture. Microenterprises not only help improve the quality of life for business owners, they also add value to the local economy. They boost purchasing power, improve income, and also create jobs.
Microfinance seeks to help microenterprises by loaning small amounts of capital to these businesses. This allows individuals or families with moderate, low, or no income to start their own businesses, earn income, and benefit their communities. Many banks grant microloans to those in need, but a great deal are provided by organizations that cater specifically to people who want to start a microenterprise. Like regular loans, they are required to pay back the funds over time with interest.
The idea of microenterprises and microfinance was developed in the late 1970s in Bangladesh as a way to provide people in need with a way to sustain themselves financially and economically. Muhammad Yunus developed Grameen Bank in 1976 to provide microloan financing to impoverished people—many of them women. Since then, a number of organizations have developed microenterprise programs, many catering to people in developing nations.
Types of Microenterprises
While individually small in size and scope, microenterprises can collectively represent a substantial portion of the economy and employment. Types of businesses that are considered microenterprises include the following:
•	Lawn and landscaping companies
•	Street vendors
•	Carpenters
•	Plumbers
•	Independent mechanics
•	Machine shop operators
•	Shoemakers
•	Small farmers
Micro Enterprise
A micro enterprise is a small business which sells goods and/or services to a local area or a local market. It employs less than 10 people generally and is geographically restricted. Typically a micro enterprise starts with some form of funding – known as micro credit or micro finance.
Micro enterprises are usually a trademark of a developing country and economy, like India’s. There is a dearth of jobs in the formal sector and micro enterprises aim to fill in the gap. They help the economy by not only creating jobs but also lowering production costs, increasing purchasing power and providing convenience.
In fact, the government encourages micro enterprises, especially in low-income areas. It helps the business and economy grow. And such enterprises also show promise of sustainable development. They help fill a necessary niche in developing economies.
For example, the local tailor shop in your area may be called a micro enterprise. He may take a small loan (micro credit) to set up his shop and buy materials. He or she employees a few workers and assistants. And they provide their goods and services in a limited area, i.e. they do not have a wide distribution network.
