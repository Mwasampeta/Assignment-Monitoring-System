Environmental assessment has come into its own since the 1970s as a key tool in environmental to. While such assessment had been practised in one form or another long before the 1970s, it is perhaps after the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, Stockholm, 1972, that environmental assessment became part of the common lexicon among environmental stakeholders as well as the private sector. Environmental assessments are conducted by various stakeholders and to meet disparate objectives as numerous as the stakeholders themselves.
